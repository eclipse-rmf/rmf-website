<h3>RMF - Requirements Modeling Framework</h3>
<div id="introText">

<p class="left">
The vision is to have at least one clean-room implementation of the
<a href="http://www.omg.org/spec/ReqIF/">OMG ReqIF</a> standard in form of an EMF model
and some rudimentary tooling to edit these models. The idea is to implement the standard
so that it is compatible with Eclipse technologies like GMF, Xpand, Acceleo, Sphinx, 
etc. and other key technologies like CDO.

<br/><br/>

<b>ReqIf Core</b> - The first initial contribution will come from <a href="http://www.itemis.com">itemis</a>
and will include our implementation of the ReqIF and RIF metamodels as .ecore models,
including special (de)serializers that map the EMF-models to a ReqIF conforming standard.
The model and (de)serializers are already available at itemis and need only be provided.
</p>

<p class="right">
<b>ProR GUI</b> - The second contribution will come from the <a href="http://www.stups.uni-duesseldorf.de/">University
of DÃ¼sseldorf</a> and will include a <a href="http://pror.org">front end that facilitates
working with ReqIF data (ProR)</a>.  While ReqIF data could also be edited with the default
EMF editor, this is not even remotely practical: a tree view of the requirements, with the 
details shown in the property view, doesn't allow users to efficiently navigate requirements 
or get an overview of what's there.

<div id="feature_1">

<h4>RIF 1.1, RIF 1.2 and ReqIf 1.0.1 Support</h4>
<p>The RMF Core supports all three formats that are in use (ProR only supports ReqIf).</p>
</div>

<div id="feature_2">
<h4>Integration in other Eclipse Tools</h4>
<p>A powerful extension point allows seamless integration with other tools.</p>
</div>

<div id="feature_3">
<h4>Super Fast</h4>
<p><a href="http://nirmalsasidharan.wordpress.com/2011/08/03/2-fast-thrice-furious/">The first performance tests</a> look very promising</p>
</div>

<div id="feature_4">
<h4>Strong Interest from Industry</h4>
